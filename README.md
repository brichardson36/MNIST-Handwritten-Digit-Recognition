# MNIST-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

## Initial Setup:
This application will require an installation of Python 3.8 to run correctly (I recommend installing via a distribution like Anaconda), and it will also require installation of a few python libraries: Tensorflow, PIL (Pillow), Flask, and flask_cors. Make sure that the latest versions of these are installed before moving to the next section (These can all easily be installed using Anaconda as well).

## To start the backend API:
Navigate to the API folder of the cloned repo directory and run the app.py file with 'python app.py'
This should start the API locally on port 5000.

## To start the Frontend App:
Navigate into the image-sender folder.
Using npm, run npm i to install needed libraries
run npm start to start the app on your localhost
